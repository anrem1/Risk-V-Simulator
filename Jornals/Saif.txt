April 14, 2024, 10:30 AM: Today, added MUL function, along with the overall design for our program. April 16, 2024, 2:45 PM: I worked on MULH, MULHU, and MULHSU instructions today.(namely, multiplication and unsigned multiplication). 
April 18, 2024, 1:10 PM: today was on implementing our DIV and DIVU instructions. 
April 20, 2024, 9:00 AM: finalized our core program, including the program counter and memory management with a map. 
April 22, 2024, 11:30 AM: Added REM and REMU instructions, which are very important for calculations involving modulus. 
April 24, 2024, 3:50 PM: JAL and JALR instructions got implemented today. These are crucial for making loops and branches, so it was important to ensure they integrate seamlessly with the program counter.
April 26, 2024, 4:15 PM: I reviewed all instructions we have done so far. It is very important that they work together along with the whole program and the program counter. 
April 27, 2024, 5:30 PM: I spent today improving our program and making sure our output displays are easy to read andÂ informative.
